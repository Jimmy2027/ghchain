    """
    Rebase the current branch onto a specified target branch or commit hash.

    This function rebases the current branch onto the target specified by the `target` parameter.
    If the `interactive` parameter is set to True, the rebase will be performed interactively.

    Args:
        target (str): The target branch or commit hash to rebase onto.
        interactive (bool, optional): Flag to perform an interactive rebase. Defaults to False.

    The function executes the rebase command using subprocess. If the rebase is interactive, it constructs
    the command accordingly and executes it with `shell=True`. In case of non-interactive rebase, it calls
    `run_command` with the constructed command.

    During the rebase, if conflicts are detected (indicated by "CONFLICT" or "needs merge" in the command output),
    the user is prompted to resolve them. After resolving conflicts, pressing Enter continues the rebase process.

    After a successful rebase, the function extracts the names of branches that were rebased (if any are reported
    in the stderr output) and pushes them to the remote repository using `--force-with-lease` to ensure safety.

    Note:
        - The `GIT_EDITOR` environment variable is set to "true" to prevent the editor from opening during
          `git rebase --continue`
